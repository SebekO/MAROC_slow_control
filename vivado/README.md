# `vivado` directory

This directory shall contain the Vivado project itself. `.gitignore` file here
makes it possible only to include the `.xpr` file which is the only file
needed to completely recreate the project. There, all the IPs and sources are
listed and will be added accordingly, as long as other directories are 
properly maintained.
