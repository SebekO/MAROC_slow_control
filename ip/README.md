# `ip` directory

This directory should contain all the IP sources. When adding new IP to the
design in Vivado, please specify this location. This directory will be included
in the VCS with all files, which is to provide compatibility after the IP cores
have been updated. If all files are controlled, together with synthesis
products etc. The update will not be necessary when cloning this repository.
